Provides a circular array that may be used by other data-structures.
As of current, circular arrays may not be shrunk.

T get(size_t i)
Thread safe. Retrieves an element at a given index.

void put(size_t i, T element)
Only thread-safe if it is guaranteed that no concurrent grow operation is issued

void is_growable()
Checks whether the array can be grown further. There might be an upper limit on growth, or 
some implementations might even provide a fixed size.

void grow(size_t bottom, size_t top)
Grows the array. Allows for concurrent get operations to be issued, but is otherwise not thread-safe.
May only be grown if array is_growable


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current Implementations:

FixedSizeCircularArray
Array-based implementation. Preallocated. May not be grown.

TwoLevelGrowingCircularArray
Uses an array of pointers to arrays. Each grow operation doubles the capacity
(Capacity is always a power of two)
May not be shrunk
